# Babylon-CLJS - 3D Character Controller Demo


`babylon-cljs` is a 3D character controller demo prototype project. It showcases how to integrate BabylonJS with ClojureScript. The project also utilizes a rule engine, with a custom wrapper around `Odoyle Rules`.

## Installation

Before you begin, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

To install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Project

Start the development server with:

```bash
npm run watch
```

Once the server is running, open your web browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:8280
```

## Exploring the Demo

As you interact with the 3D character controller, the rule engine processes various rules. The wrapper around `odoyle rules` assists in this, offering a seamless integration with BabylonJS in the ClojureScript environment.

Feel free to explore, tweak, and test different configurations to see how the system responds.
